The top 10 programming languages for 2015 are:
1. C
2. Java
3. Objective-C
4. C++
5. C#
6. PHP
7. JavaScript
8. Python
9. Perl
10. PL/SQL

Comparison between C and C#:
C is much older than C#. In C you have to write a lot more code to get it to do something right. It also does not support object oriented code.

Comparison between Java and C#:
Both this languages are object oriented. C# and Java use the same generic syntax but they actually handle generics very differently. 

Comparison between Objective-C and C#:
Objective C is strict C (or C++ with .mm files), compiled straight to machine language coupled with a dynamic object system.  

Comparison between C++ and C#:
C# builds on the syntax and semantics of C++.  C++ was designed to be a low-level platform-neutral object-oriented programming language. C# was designed to be a somewhat higher-level component-oriented language. 

Comparison between PHP and C#:
C# is just a programming language as PHP is, but with the difference that C# targets a platform (.NET) that also accepts other languages, including PHP. You may create PHP applications for the .NET platform, taking thus the best of both.
